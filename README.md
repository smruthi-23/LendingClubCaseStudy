Assigment by Upgrad and IIIT-B

The case study focuses on EDA mainly, to understand which parameters are major to detect whether a customer will default loan or not.

## Introduction

Analysis of the project desciption:

Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss
(called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed.

Objective:

The main objective is to be able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 
Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

Steps:

Step 1: Data Cleaning
Step 2: Data Conversion
Step 3: Removing Outliers
Step 4: Univariate Analysis
Step 5: Segmented Univariate Analysis
Step 6: Bivariate Analysis
Step 5: Result


## Conclusions

Perform an analysis to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e.the variables which are strong indicators of default.  
The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
